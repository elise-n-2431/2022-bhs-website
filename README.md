# 2022-bhs-website
This is a website project created between 2021 and 2022.
The respository was formerly linked to @eliseschool, my past account which was lost with the school email accounts.
This project was designed to replace the Burnside School website after the moodle page was replaced by a slow website designed
to attract new students to the school. It was to be an alternative with more student features such as improving club finding 
and making the schools divisional points competition more visible.
